Tools for finding anagrams
No longer maintained (not like it ever was). probably still works and will keep working

## Uses
anagram-finder is a standalone program that when given an input word, checks if that word has any anagrams in its local dictionary. (./Resources/words.txt)

## Installation
To run this you need to have python 3.9, and have downloaded the Resources folder and put it in the directory of anagram-finder.py
Just download the anagram-finder file, and run it (ex: python3 anagram-finder.py) in a environment that supports the input() function.
It will ask you for a word, and when you give it one, it will start searching the dicitionary for anagrams.

## Extras
The file anagram-checker is a dev version of anagram-finder, and it can only check weather two words are anagrams. It does not need the Resources folder, but still uses input()

## Coming soon (ish)
I intend to make anagram-finder into a library soon, and add a larger dicitionary, with less proper nouns. (words.txt is taken from a spell checking dicitionary)
